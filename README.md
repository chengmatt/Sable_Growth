## Abstract

Growth processes mediate survival and fecundity within fish populations, which are fundamental in regulating population dynamics. Therefore, accurate estimates of population scale and sustainable exploitation levels in contemporary fishery stock assessment models rely heavily on understanding and accurately characterizing growth processes. However, empirical studies that relate population-level changes in growth patterns to observable ecosystem and population conditions remain scarce. In particular, few studies directly consider the influence of intra-specific competition (i.e., cohort effects) on growth variability, and its associated implications for stock assessment estimates. Focusing on Alaska sablefish as a case study, we illustrate how multiple unprecedented large recruitment events since 2014 resulted in density-dependent declines in growth on the population-level scale, using a state-space growth model. Furthermore, we demonstrate how incorporating cohort-specific growth variability within the Alaska sablefish stock assessment model resulted in substantial differences in estimates of spawning biomass and recommended harvest levels. Overall, results from this study underscore the significance of cohort effects on growth processes and their implications for stock assessment models and associated harvest recommendations.
